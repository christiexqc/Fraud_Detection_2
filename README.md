Fraud Detection Case Study
Data: fraud_data.csv
Notebook:fraud_detection.ipynb

The data is from an  e-commerce site that sells hand-made clothes.
I  built a model that predicts whether a user has a high probability of using the site to perform some illegal activity or not. 

we only  information about the user first transaction on the site and based on that you have to make your classification (“fraud/no fraud”).

Tasks which were accomplished:

1 For each user, determined their country based on the IP address


2 Built a model to predict whether an activity is fraudulent or not. Explained how different assumptions about the cost of false positives vs false negatives would impact the model


3 Explained the  model  from a user perspective. What kinds of users are more likely to be classified as at risk? What are their characteristics?


4 Given the condition we are running model  in real time , From a product perspective, explained what kind of user experience we might have.
